            <p> <i>HTML</i> elements are the building blocks of <i> HTML</i> pages. With <I>HTML</I> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
             <i>HTML</i> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
             <i> HTML </i> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <-image> and <-input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <-p> and <-/p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
